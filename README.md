# SP_Advanced-Secure-Protocol-Design-Implementation-and-Review
This is a repository created for the Secure Programming assignments whereas students in the group needs to implement a Secure Protocol. 


## Introduction 
- Our goal is to implement a simple lightweight secure chat protocol. In this document it will discuss how this protocol works and commands. 

- Language used for Implementation: Python, JSON

## Assignment Objectives
- Conceptualising and standardising a secure communication protocol for a distributed overlay multi-party chat system.
- There cannot be any central server handling all the communication. Rather, the system must be robust to any node or device failure. 
- Develop an application that adheres to a designed protocol (us) and incorporates advanced secure coding practices.  
- Intentionally backdoor your own implementation in an ethical way so that other groups have security flaws to find. 
- Perform peer reviews and engage in both manual and automated code analysis to identify vulnerabilities and backdoors.  
- Critically reflect on the design and implementation process, including evaluating the protocol, the security measures implemented, the quality of the feedback received, a reflection on your own learning and possible coding mistakes.
- Have fun at an ethical hackathon to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a controlled setting, enhancing your understanding of real-world cybersecurity challenges.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Create virtual environment (recommended)
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

2. Run the test server
bash

python server/echo_server.py

3. Run the client
bash

python client/client.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9000 --nick hsk

4. Available commands
bash

/join <room>             # join a chat room
/msg <message>           # send message to the room
/send <path>             # sending a file
/send dm:<nick> <path>   # sending file via dm 
/leave                   # leave current room
/quit                    # disconnect
