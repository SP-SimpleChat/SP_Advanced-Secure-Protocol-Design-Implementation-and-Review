# SP_Advanced-Secure-Protocol-Design-Implementation-and-Review
This is a repository created for the Secure Programming assignments whereas students in the group needs to implement a Secure Protocol. 


## Introduction 
- Our goal is to implement a simple lightweight secure chat protocol. This protocol will be WebSocket based. In this document it will discuss the protocol design and its structure. 

- Language used for Implementation: Python, JSON 

## Everything in a nutshell: 
- Basically, we are making a WebSocket in python that allows many clients to connect on one server. Later we need to make sure all the text, files, picture or user password are secured.

## Assignment Objectives
- Conceptualising and standardising a secure communication protocol for a distributed overlay multi-party chat system.
- There cannot be any central server handling all the communication. Rather, the system must be robust to any node or device failure. 
- Develop an application that adheres to a designed protocol (us) and incorporates advanced secure coding practices.  
- Intentionally backdoor your own implementation in an ethical way so that other groups have security flaws to find. 
- Perform peer reviews and engage in both manual and automated code analysis to identify vulnerabilities and backdoors.  
- Critically reflect on the design and implementation process, including evaluating the protocol, the security measures implemented, the quality of the feedback received, a reflection on your own learning and possible coding mistakes.
- Have fun at an ethical hackathon to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a controlled setting, enhancing your understanding of real-world cybersecurity challenges.
