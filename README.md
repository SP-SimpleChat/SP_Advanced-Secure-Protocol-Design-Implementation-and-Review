## Assignment Objectives
https://github.com/ZY1901357/SP_Advanced-Secure-Protocol-Design-Implementation-and-Review/edit/main/README.md
- Conceptualising and standardising a secure communication protocol for a distributed overlay multi-party chat system.
- There cannot be any central server handling all the communication. Rather, the system must be robust to any node or device failure. 
- Develop an application that adheres to a designed protocol (by the class) and incorporates advanced secure coding practices.  
- Intentionally backdoor your own implementation in an ethical way so that other groups have security flaws to find. 
- Perform peer reviews and engage in both manual and automated code analysis to identify vulnerabilities and backdoors.  
- Critically reflect on the design and implementation process, including evaluating the protocol, the security measures implemented, the quality of the feedback received, a reflection on your own learning and possible coding mistakes.
- Have fun at an ethical hackathon to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a controlled setting, enhancing your understanding of real-world cybersecurity challenges.
